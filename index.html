      Happy Birthday to the tube-light of our gang 🎉💥 From playing skribble in 3rd sem to sitting in olives and pulling your legs, we've spent less time than your brain spends processing my jokes on you, yet it's memorable. Thanks for finding me annoying, something not many can do. Much memories to make in the upcoming year! Hope your day is surprisingly beautiful 🍻. Stay awesome (and slightly tolerable). 🎉😈

      HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my favorite person ever! 🎉💖 From sharing snacks in class to sharing secrets after school, you’ve been my constant — my best friend, my personal clown, and sometimes, my brutally honest therapist 😅. You’re the most real, raw, and rare gem I’ve ever had the joy of knowing. Keep slaying and laughing loud, love you loads Amrutha! 💕🎂

      At 20, you’re officially too old to count your age on your fingers. In dog years, you are dead 😂... but in Amrutha years, you're just getting started! WELCOME TO THE 20s… where absolutely nothing changes (except how quickly you get tired). 🥰😍😜

      From the very first day of college, when I met you, I had a feeling we were going to be good friends. And here we are — laughs, tears, and a million little moments later. You’re a light in my life, and I cherish this friendship for a lifetime. Happy Birthday Amrutha! 🎉💖
